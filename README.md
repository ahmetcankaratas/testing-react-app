## Notes

### Patterns
Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for organizing unit tests. It breaks tests down into three clear and distinct steps:

<p>1.Arrange: Perform the setup and initialization required for the test.</p>
<p>2.Act: Take action(s) required for the test.</p>
<p>3.Assert: Verify the outcome(s) of the test.</p>
